# PasswordManager
## Description
A password manager function with several features. Initially, the user is prompted to enter a master username and password that the user can set before hand. The user has 3 attempts to enter the master information correctly, else the program records it as a breach attempt at the exact time and date and stops the program.

Once the user enters the information successfully, they are routed to the main menu. In the menu they have access to the various features. They can add, view, delete or generate a password. They can also quit the program from the main menu.

## Using the Program
To use the password manager, set your master username and password in lines 24 and 25, and input your name in line 265!
